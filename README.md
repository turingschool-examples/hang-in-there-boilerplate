# Hang In There

A web page displaying inspirational posters created with atom, GitHub, Node.js, javascript, HTML and CSS.

[Hang In There] (https://rachelbuchta.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/)

### Introduction

We have created a web page designed to generate random inspirational posters that include an image, a title and a quote. The user is able to create their own posters by uploading an image, a title and a quote of their own. If there is a poster the user would like to keep, they can click to save it in a separate area of the page and double click to delete as they feel ready!

This web page was created to help us build a deeper understanding of how javascript, HTML and CSS work together by manipulating the DOM to create an enjoyable experience for the user. This project helped familiarize us with event handlers, event handler functions and to begin putting the skills we have been cultivating into a real-life scenario.

### Instructions

- After the user clicks the **Make Your Own Poster** button, they are brought to the Form View.
- If they did not mean to navigate to the Form View, the user can click the **Nevermind, take me back!** button to be directed back to the Main View.
- The user is met with three input fields that allow them to upload an image URL, a title and a quote of their choice.
- These inputs are saved into the Saved Posters category which contains the rest of the random images, titles and quotes, so that users are able to access the content they previously stored.
- When the user clicks the **Show My Poster** button, they are congratulated with an alert and then navigated back to the Main View which then displays a poster that has the image, title and quote they just entered.
- If the user likes the poster they have created, they can then click the **Save This Poster** button to save it in the Saved Posters category with the rest of the posters they have saved to access later.
- If the user would like to create a new poster, they can click the **Make Your Own Poster** button again and are met with a cleared form ready for new inputs!
