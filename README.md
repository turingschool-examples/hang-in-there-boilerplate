 # Hang In There

A boilerplate repo. 

## Set Up



# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
  Briefly, this is a site that allows users to view, create, and save motivational and unmotivational posters, because sometimes you just need a pick me up.  To start there was no functionality for the page. No posters, none of the buttons worked, just place markers essentially.  By working through the iterations, the funtionality was solved by writing new code into the .JS, .CSS, and HTML.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
  From assignment, until submission I had 9 days to start and complete the project.  Intermixed with class, and other homework, my time was not 100% devoted to this project.  As of submission, this is my second week of Mod 2 at Turing.
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to your GitHub. Consider also providing LinkedIn link)
  This was a solo project, so I am the only one who worked on it.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
  The goals for this project were to increase JavaScript, CSS, and HTML proficiancy.  Starting with a brownfield project, I was able to practice reading and understanding existing code.  From there using the skills learned in class, follow the iterations and build out the functionality.  Finaly using the provided comp views, attempt to match styling and layout.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
  My biggest win by far is feeling that I know what I wrote.  There was a lot of second guessing and a lot of time spent referencing but I am pretty happy overall.  Also, creating a poster, while the code was a challenge, seeing a poster was awesome!!.
    From the get go, I felt this was a challenge.  Starting a project while still learning the material was tough.  Though, it did provide some excitement moments of "I know where I will use this lesson!"  The CSS while, I believe we are only scratching the surface, is a crazy deep rabbit hole.  Being able to talk through problems with classmates and mentor was helpful.  Sometimes, I was on the right path, and just didn't realize it, others I was not.  I tried to be better at recognizing un productive struggles, and taking breaks to clear myself.
