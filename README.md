### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The Hang In There project has us build a website that creates Motivational Posters.  We created code to randomly pull an element of given arrays of images, titles, and quotes to generate a random poster.  We then added more functionality by letting the user create their own personal poster by filling in fields for their own pictures, motivational quotes, and titles.  Lastly, we provided functionality for the user to save and delete any of the randomized or user-created posters.
