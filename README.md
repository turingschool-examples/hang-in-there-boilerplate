## About
This is our first paired project for Turing School of Software & Design. We were given the HTML and CSS files containing the structure and styling of the app along with some of the functinality elements of Javascript to build on top of. Our task was to develop Javascript functionality and work across the DOM to create a random poster generator using pre-assigned data for the posters. 

The user can pull from a library of images, titles, and quotes to create a randomly generated poster by clicking the “Show Another Random Poster” button.

They also have the option of inputing their own data to generate their own unique poster by clicking on the “Make Your Own Poster” button.

Users can save any poster they create or randomly generate by clicking on "Save This Poster" and all saved posters are displayed at the bottom of the page when "Show Saved Posters" is clicked.
