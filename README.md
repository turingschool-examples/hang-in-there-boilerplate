# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application will allow users to view randomly generated motivational posters with a title, quote, and image. It also allows users to create their own motivational posters by inputting their own title, quote, and image address. The users can also save their chosen motivational posters to view later and also delete it.

This app solves users' potential bad mood by displaying a motivational poster.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Unfortunately, this app is web-based and will only work on a browser. To access it, they will need follow several steps: 

To clone down this repository to your local machine:
* Fork the Tick-Tack-Toe repository
* Clone down the repository to your local machine
* `cd` into the repository on your local machine
* Open the repository in your text editor
* From there you should be able to open the Javascript, CSS, and HTML files, as well as the functioning appplication through a web browser using the command `open index.html`. 

Alternatively, a user can demo the application using the following link:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This was completed by students who were in week 2 of module 1 in Turing School of Software and Design's curriculum.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals include:
- writing short, effective code that completes the desired goal without being redundant
- begin to understand the how HTML, CSS, and JS function together to create a working website
- begin writing code collaboratively and effectivly using the Git workflow

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- successfully pushing "currentPoster" into the "savedPosters" array
- successfully deleting motivational posters after double clicking on it

Challenges:
- realizing we had some bugs in our code from iterations 1 and 2 when we got to iterations 3 and 4 and we got over them by collaborating with peers
