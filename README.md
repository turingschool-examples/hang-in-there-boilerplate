# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This is a Motivational/Un-motivational poster website. You can create random motivational posters and custom posters and save them to be perused at a later time. Also has an optional Un-motivational section that you can peruse.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Pull  the GitHub repo and run `open index.html` from the directory you have the repo pulled to.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
The project was introduced as the first project for Mod 2 with a focus on front-end develpoment. We were given a week to build the website and functions per the evaluation rubric. 
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to your GitHub. Consider also providing LinkedIn link)
Jeremiah Ross is the sole contributor to the project at this time.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
  - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
  - Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
  - Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
- Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

Primarily used VScode and a few of their plugins for ease of viewing the HTML and modifying it. MDN docs were heavily used to find preexisting functions I could manipulate to accomplish mmy desisred tasks.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins
 - Discovered use of the `.closest()` function when using events to find the closest element with a specific class
 - Able to find a way to set eventlisteners in functions (though was adviced not to do this for the project)
 Updating the DOM vs updating the arrays, had several issues where I could update one but not the other. Research into the doms to find how to toggle specific classes.
