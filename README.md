# Hang in There  - Jen Nguyen & Banjamin Hatch 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?) 
  We built the javascript framework to get the webiste working. The website generates random inspirational posters with an image, title, and quote to make the user feel good. The problem is solved by the website actually being functional! They user can generate random posters, create their own posters, save posters and delete posters from the saved poster page, they can also not generate a poster unless all form fields are filled out.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The user can navigate to the github repo by using https://github.com/Jnguyen615/hang-in-there. From there the user would clone down the repository by using git clone and copying the ssh key located under the green dropdown 'code' button. They type git clone + the ssh key. Once cloned the user should navigate to their terminal and and in the repository folder, then type `open index.html` in the terminal. This will open the page in the users internet browser. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had one full week to work on the project. We started the second day, after a lesson which was necessary. We did do some pseduocoding prior to starting. It took us approximately 15-20 hours. We are in mod one currenlty.  

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
He had two contributors on this project, the links to their githubs are: 
Banjamin Hatch : https://github.com/banjaminh

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?) 
Our learning goals were to focus on functionality that incorporate dry javascript with the functionality trending towards the single responsibility principle, which is each function doing one thing. We had to build all of the functionality of the webpage to get it running. We had to manipulate the page by updating the DOM. Another goal was understaning how javascript, css and html all connect. We also had to work on how to write code collaboratively with good effective communication, troubleshooting and planning. This also included making sure we documented changes properly with commiting to github. We made sure we both had equal responisiblities for the code. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?) 
Our best wil is we both have a new networking buddy and friend out of working together on this project. Other wins were learning how to write your own code and be able to read and explain another's code. We also completed the project in a timely enough manner to implement another feature, which will not allow the user to create their own poster, unless all three input fields are filled. Our biggest challenge had to do with naming convnetions, for variables, functions and even branches. We needed to be more rigorous with checking the code for minor mistakes in our variables and look for mistyped words which caused a lot of headaches and lost time.
