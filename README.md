## Project Goals
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data.
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword.
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded. Add, remove, and update elements on the DOM.
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Overview
Sometimes you need a pick me up. Remember those motivational posters that were all over the place in classrooms and online? We’re going to make our own!

## Instructions For Running and Viewing
**Visit the deploy link [here.](https://tashiad.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/ "Hang In There Deployed Site")**

Upon visiting the site, you will see a motivational poster generated from a random of a list of images, titles, and quotes. Click _"Show Another Random Poster"_ to view a different randomized motivational poster.

If you like the poster shown and want to be able to view it later, click the _"Save This Poster"_ button. Then, click _"Show Saved Posters"_ to view a grid of the posters you've chosen to save. From there, the _"Back to Main"_ button will take you back to the main screen.

Once back on the main screen, you can make your own poster by clicking _"Make Your Own Poster"_. This will bring up the form, where you can enter an image link, title, and quote of your choosing. Click _"Show My Poster"_ to view it.

If you like it, you can repeat the steps from earlier to save it. Your inputs will also be stored for use in future randomized posters.

## Future Features
- From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
- Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
- In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array
- When a user single clicks a saved poster, create a modal to view it larger
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
