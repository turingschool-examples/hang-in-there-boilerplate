### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    This web application allows users to generate random posters from a limited set of variables. Then, users are able to create their own personal poster by filling out a form with custom input. Additionally, users are able to save and view randomly generated posters in gallery format. If a user so chooses they are able to delete unwanted posters form the gallery view. This allows users to create a random poster with more convenience and fewer hurdles than they would encounter if they were creating them from a blank slate.
​
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
    1. Clone down the repo using GitHub. GitHub provides a link which can be used in the terminal after typing `github clone <cloned link from GitHub>.`
    2. Enter the respective directory in the terminal. Then type `open index.html` to open the website in an Internet browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

    This is a screenshot of the poster that is generated when a user fills out the form after clicking the "Make Your Own Poster" button.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
    We worked on this project for 5 days. We were both two weeks into the 2210 front-end engineering program for Turing. This was our first paired project where we collaborated and coded in tandem.

​
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
​
##### Wins:
- We were able to successfully employ the communication and scheduling norms we agreed upon at the outset.
- We were able to collaborate effectively as a team.
- We were successfully able to implement new technical concepts such as the `.target` property.
​
##### Challenges:
- We experienced an issue when trying to get multiple posters to display in our gallery. One main issue involved pushing in already saved posters. We resolved the issue by updating the `.innerHTML` property. 
- We also experienced an issue in trying to get posters to be deleted in our gallery. We resolved this issue by replacing the `===` with `==` and improved our knowledge of actual equals versus equals equals operators.
- We also had some hurdles in balancing our personal needs while we were trying to make sure the web app was completed.
