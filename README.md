# Module 1 Paired Project: Hang In There

### Abstract  
The learning goals of this project are to write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data, to use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword, to manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM, and to begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Technologies Used  
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How to Use the Application  
This application allows the user to view randomized inspirational posters. It's motivation with a twist, as the title, quote, and image hardly ever align! In addition, the user can create their own poster using a form. Any poster, whether created or randomly generated, can be saved and then also deleted.

### Illustrations  
// we need to place in the images or giphys here!

### Install and Setup

1. Fork [this project](https://github.com/edwardkrupicka/hang-in-there).  
2. Clone down your new, forked repo. You can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.  
3. `cd` into the repository.
4. Explore all the files (main.js is the only file that was written for this project, the rest were given).  
5. Run `open index.html` in order to interact with the application.

### Future Iterations  
- Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable button, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc).
- In the main poster view, allow users to click each piece of the poster (image, title, quote) to update just that piece with another random item from the appropriate array.
- Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear.
